# WebAssembly QR Scanner
This repository contains code from a tutorial blogpost hosted on https://peterkins.dev

# Description
This is a WebAssembly QR Scanner built with Preact and Typescript. We use [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev) to initialize our project strucure, and a WASM implementation of [QUIRC](https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc) for our image recognition and QR decoding logic.
